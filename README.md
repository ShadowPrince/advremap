PS Vita homebrew for remapping controls.

## Features

* Remap any button, sticks (4 directions), back touchscreen (4 virtual buttons)
* Remap single button to button combination
* Configure front and back touchscreen, left and right stick deadzones
* GUI

## Troubleshoot
* Plugin doesn't work:
  * Pirated games not supported
  * If the notice message doesn't appear in the game: make sure that you've edited taiHEN's `config.txt` and reloaded it trough `molecularShell`
  * Other way the game may be unsupported

* Config not saved
  * Make sure that you've added at least 1 button
